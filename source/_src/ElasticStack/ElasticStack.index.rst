Introduction
=================

The ELK stack is an amazing and powerful collection of three open source projects -
**E**\lasticsearch, **L**\ogstash, and **K**\ibana.

Despite each one of these three technologies being a separate project,
they have been built to work exceptionally well together.

Elastic Stack is a complete end-to-end log analysis solution
which helps in deep **searching**, **analyzing** and **visualizing**
the log generated from different machines.
