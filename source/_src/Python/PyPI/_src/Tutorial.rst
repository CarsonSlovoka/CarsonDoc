How to Pronounce?
***********************

PyPy is pronounced ``pie pie``,

PyPI is pronounced ``pie pee eye`` or ``the cheeseshop``.

*********************
Publish To PyPI
*********************

Create Account
====================

If you don't have an account yet, go to the `official website <https://pypi.org/>`_ to register an account:

Settings (account, password)
========================================

**load account and password from config**

    create ``.pypirc`` file at ``%USERPROFILE%/.pypirc``

    **file contents**::

        [distutils]
        index-servers =
          pypi
          pypitest

        [pypi]
        repository = https://pypi.python.org/pypi
        username = your_name
        password = ???

        [pypitest]
        repository = https://testpypi.python.org/pypi
        username= your_name
        password= ???

    .. note::

        that will publish to two websites (pypi and pypitest) at the same time.

        just remove if you won't need someone

Prepare Data
====================

Set your directory structure are as follows:

    \file
        * .setup.py [#note-setup.py]_
        * MANIFEST.in
        * README.{rst, md}

        .. note:: README file is not necessary to be located here but recommended

        * requirements.txt (Option)

        .. note::

            **list all packages:**
                * pip list
                * pip freeze > requirements.txt

            **install packages by requirements.txt:**
                pip install -r requirements.txt

        * LICENSE (Option)
    \directory
        * {packages} [#note-packages]_

        .. note:: name of "packages" is an example, not necessary named to same.

    .. important:: Remember! These are all related to the contents of the ``setup.py`` [#note-setup.py]_ file.

.. [#note-setup.py] name of "setup.py" is not necessary named to so, but this has been used or accepted in the society.
.. [#note-packages] After you `pip install {project}` finished that will also install those files that is what you append anything of files or directory in packages directory.

Write contents
====================

MANIFEST.in
-----------------------

\Manifest-related options:
    * if the manifest file (MANIFEST by default) exists and the first line does not have a comment indicating it is generated from MANIFEST.in, then it is used as is, unaltered
    * ``if the manifest file doesnâ€™t exist or has been previously automatically generated, read MANIFEST.in data to create the manifest``
    * if neither MANIFEST nor MANIFEST.in exist, create a manifest with just the default file set
    * use the list of files now in MANIFEST (either just generated or read in) to create the source distribution archive(s)

\contents:
    ::

        include LICENSE
        include *.txt # include all files in the distribution root matching *.txt

        exclude temp.py test.py  #

        recursive-include examples *.txt *.py  # all files anywhere under the examples directory matching *.txt or *.py
        recursive-exclude examples *.test

        prune dir  # exclude all files under dir
        prune examples/sample?/build  # exclude all directories matching examples/sample?/build.

        graft dir  # include all files under dir
        graft Carson\Class

.. important:: every items of MANIFEST.in are promise able to download, but it doesn't mean that can put those to ``Python\Lib\site-packages`` path.

setup.py

.. important:: you must set `.py` path assign to ``packages`` variable instead of writing at MANIFEST.in otherwise, it will not put those files to ``Python\Lib\site-packages``

..  tip:: `Learn more > <https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/?highlight=manifest#setup-args>`_

**************
build
**************

There are three major `setup.py` commands we will use:


\bdist_egg:
    This creates an egg file. This is what is necessary so someone can use ``esay_install your_project``.

    .. note::

        `easy_install` is old fashioned! I'll suggest you using pip install too instead of it.

        that is because ``pip`` provide more information to tell you what's happening.

\bdist_wininst
    This will create an ``.exe`` that will install your project on a windows machine.

    That will put "Remove{project}.exe" and "{project}-winiest.log" at the Python directory.

    "{project}-winiest.log" recorded all install information so that when uninstall that can delete all files (include registry values) by reference.

    .. note:: if you want to uninstall, you may use the ``Add or Remove`` programs to do that.

\sdist:
    This create a raw source distribution which someone can download and run ``python setup.py`` directly.


    .. note:: full command: ``python setup.py sdist``
