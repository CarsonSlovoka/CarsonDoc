Introduction
=================

The reStructuredText (RST) syntax provides an easy-to-read,

what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup syntax and parser system.

However, you need to be very precise and stick to some strict rules:

like Python, RST syntax is sensitive to indentation!

RST requires blank lines between paragraphs.
